# Haskell-Practice
various haskell practice exercises to help me get ready for the plutus pioneer program
This will be a repo where I post different haskell coding challenges. My goal is to master Haskell so I can hopefully be accepted into Cardano's Plutus Pioneer Program.
All of these coding practice probelms are from https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html
